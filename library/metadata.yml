        A "Level 1" (for MoClo) plasmid backbone from the JUMP ("Joint Universal Modular Plasmids") library. It contains a superfolder GFP (sfGFP) reporter gene that drops out when plasmid assembly (via Golden Gate, MoClo, Gibson, etc.) is successful.

        For details on the "1A" suffix, read the paper linked below.
